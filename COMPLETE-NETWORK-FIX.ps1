.SYNOPSIS
    Complete WSL2 Networking Fix - Mirrored Mode + Port Forwarding + Claude Config
    
.DESCRIPTION
    Implements the complete solution for WSL2 to Windows networking issues:
    1. WSL2 Mirrored Networking Mode (preferred)
    2. Port Forwarding Fallback (if mirrored mode fails)
    3. Clean-Cut-MCP Configuration (automatic)
    
.EXAMPLE
    .\COMPLETE-NETWORK-FIX.ps1
    Run complete networking fix and configure Claude Desktop
