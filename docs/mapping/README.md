# Clean-Cut-MCP Project Mapping

This directory contains comprehensive documentation and analysis of the Clean-Cut-MCP project structure, similar to professional project documentation.

## 📋 Contents

### Core Documentation
- **[PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)** - Complete project overview and architecture
- **[COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](./COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Component relationships and hierarchy
- **[MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE.md](./MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - MCP server tools and validation system
- **[VALIDATION_SYSTEM.md](./VALIDATION_SYSTEM.md)** - Validation rules and enforcement mechanisms
- **[DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](./DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md)** - Development and deployment guide

### Interactive Analysis Tool
- **[Project Deep Dive Skill](../.claude/skills/project-deep-dive.js)** - Interactive skill for real-time project analysis

## 🎯 Purpose

This mapping provides:
1. **Complete Directory Structure** - Every file and directory with its purpose
2. **Component Architecture** - React components, their relationships, and data flow
3. **MCP Server Details** - All 18 tools, validation system, and learning capabilities
4. **Docker Architecture** - Container setup, bind mounts, and deployment workflow
5. **Development Workflow** - Build, test, and deployment processes
6. **Validation System** - Professional standards and user learning mechanisms

## 🔍 Using the Interactive Skill

To perform a real-time deep dive analysis of the project:

```bash
# Run the skill directly
node .claude/skills/project-deep-dive.js
```

The skill will:
- Analyze the current project structure
- Map all components and their relationships
- Document MCP tools and validation rules
- Analyze Docker configuration and workflow
- Generate a comprehensive report

## 📊 Key Findings
